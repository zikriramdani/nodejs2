# Conference Call
A conference call implementation using WebRTC, Socket.io and Node.js.

# Getting Started
- Run `npm i`
- `cd src`
- `node app.js`

# Features
 
# Demo

# Note
You can create a free xirsys account and use their free ice server. You can replace the one used with your own at `src/assets/js/helpers.js`, function `getIceServer()`. The demo may not work as my xirsys account has been deactivated for reasons best known to them (perhaps the hits were too much) and I am not ready to create a new one. Create yours or look for an alternative.


# Alternative
If you prefer to use PHP Web socket (Ratchet) instead of socket.io and NodeJS, check out the PHP version [here]
